<h1>The Builders Shed</h1> 

<h2>User Centric FrontEnd Development Milestone Project.</h2>

<p>This site is about fictional workshop setup by someone who is passionate 
about electronics and programming.</p>

<h2>UX:</h2>

<p>The website showcases The Builders Shed, a workshop built by an electronics enthusiast, who wanted to create a place for people who wish to learn about electronics and programming but are not sure where to start.</p>
<p>The websites purpose is to showcase the workshop, the tools and the available facilities. The idea is to create a safe and controlled environment where anyone can come to learn how to use tools such as soldering irons, oscilloscopes and power supply's and also learn to programme various languages.</p>
<p>The layout of the website is designed to show what you could expect in the workshop, for example scheduled talks on many different topics, late evening opening so anyone can come in see if The Builders Shed is for them and event nights.</p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>

<h4>User - 1 Electronics Hobbyist</h4>
<p>As an electronics hobbyist I would want to use this platform to meet more people who are also interested in electronics.</p>

<h4>User - 2 Hobbyist Programmer</h4>
<p>As a hobbyist programmer this platform could be very useful in meeting other programmers and people within the software industry.</p>

<h4>User - 3 Parent and child</h4>
<p>As a parent who's child has shown an interest in computers, computer programming or electronics, The Builders Shed would be an ideal place to introduce them to experts within these fields.</p>

<h4>User - 4 Project Builder</h4>
<p>As someone already into electronics but wishing to start a project that requirers more advanced tools, ie: Oscilloscope, Signal Generator. The Builder Shed would be a place where they could rent this equipment for a modest price.</p>

<h4>User - 5 Average Computer User</h4>
<p>As an average computer user wishing to switch from Windows to Linux, The Builders Shed would provide an excellent opportunity to learn about Linux, what it has to offer and how to set up and use Linux.</p>

<p>The Builders Shed has changed quite a bit from it's original conception.
Originally the site started out with three pages but as more features were
implemented, it became apparent that three pages would not be enough.</p>
<p>It was also felt that content was too close to contact so the content page became services, I also added an about page to provide a short Bio for each of The Builders Shed experts.</p>

<h2>Media</h2>

<p>All images are from <a href="https://unsplash.com/" rel="nofollow">Unsplash</a> <q>The internetâ€™s source of freely-usable images.</q>
And were edited using <a href="https://www.online-image-editor.com/" rel="nofollow">OIE</a> A free online image editor.</p>
<p>Spelling and grammar was checked using <a href="https://www.reverso.net/spell-checker/english-spelling-grammar/" rel="nofollow">ReversoSpeller</a> an online grammar and spell checker.<p\>

Originally the image carousel was going to be placed on the contact page, but after I decided it would be better placed on the services page.</p>
