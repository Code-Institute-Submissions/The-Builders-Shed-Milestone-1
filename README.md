<h1>The Builders Shed</h1> 

User Centric FrontEnd Development Milestone Project.

This site is about fictional workshop setup by someone who is passionate 
about electronics and programming.

UX:

<p>The website showcases The Builders Shed, a workshop built by an electronics enthusiast, who wanted to create a place for people who wish to learn about electronics and programming but are not sure where to start.</p>
<p>The websites purpose is to showcase the workshop, the tools and the available facilities. The idea is to create a safe and controlled environment where anyone can come to learn how to use tools such as soldering irons, oscilloscopes and power supply's and also learn to programme various languages.</p>
<p>The layout of the website is designed to show what you could expect in the workshop, for example scheduled talks on many different topics, late evening opening so anyone can come in see if The Builders Shed is for them and event nights.</p>
